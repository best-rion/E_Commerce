# E_Commerce

A full featured E-commerce website with Frontend, Backend and Database using Python Flask.

A few days ago I followed the tutorial of a youtuber named CoreyMS, and followed the tutorial step by step and completed the series.

After completing the tutorial I decided to try out my skill and started this project on my own. I stucked many times, watched the videos again for problems that I faced in this project.
I learned many new things, jQuery being one of them. Let me tell you the context. In flask, the website reloads everytime a post request is sent. For better User Experience I decided to post "Add to cart" action using jQuery. jQuery allows us to send post request withou reloading the page each time. I am new to backend and I am still learning.
